README
Program takes an EDIF File and converts it into a custom graph format that is easily read into a 
program using C/C++ that does not parse files well

e2v.exe make

Program uses Torc framework. Source needs Torc dependencies to be installed. 

The folder contains the necessary torc dependent source in order to make the program.

The Makefiles expect Boost to be installed in /usr/local/include/boost-1_42. Need to have boost libraries 1.42

Please also make sure that the boost libraries are in /usr/lib
Ex: 
/usr/lib/lboost_filesystem.so.1.42*
/usr/lib/lboost_regex.so.1.42*
/usr/lib/lboost_signals.so.1.42*
/usr/lib/lboost_system.so.1.42*
/usr/lib/lboost_thread.so.1.42*

Once dependencies have been met, you can type make to make the program. 

Source files are located in
./torc/example/e2v.cpp
./torc/generic/VerilogExporter.cpp
./torc/generic/VerilogExporter.hpp
